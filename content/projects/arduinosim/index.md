## Description

An Arduino simulator for a line following robot.
The simulator can be configured to work with 1 to 3 sensors (and more).

Just paste your cpp algorithm (with init and loop methods), it should work as is.

## Context

Based on a robot made for 2CI03 `Techniques et projets de r√©alisation`.

This simulator allowed us to test our own line follower algorithm without acess to the robot or the board.
