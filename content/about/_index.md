Hi!

Engineering Student in Computer Science & Video Games

I started programming in 2018 with C++ and Qt to create small projects.
Then, I was interested in Javascript for a Discord bot.
I officially make Minecraft plugins (Java) since 2021.

Creating scripts and discovering new technologies to automate my life
is a never-ending hobby, and I like it.

Currently, I spend most of my spare time discovering Arch Linux and related softwares (KDE, Wayland, Wine, Btrfs, ...).
They even push me to use them on Windows!
([Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh),
[Atuin](https://atuin.sh),
[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide),
[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf),
[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io))

Sometimes, I play games.
Mostly Minecraft, Factorio and BeamNG.
